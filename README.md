Software Development student from Brazil.

Hi all, I'm Diogo Zangirolani.
I love studying web design and I'm a big fan of front-end development.
So far, I have studied **HTML** and **CSS** (having a special consideration for responsive layouts), **JavaScript**, **ReactJS**, **PHP**, **SQL** and I'm sure there is lot ahead.

You may reach me out in English, Portuguese or Spanish.
